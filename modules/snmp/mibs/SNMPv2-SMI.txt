ExtUTCTime ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(11 | 13))
    -- format is YYMMDDHHMMZ or YYYYMMDDHHMMZ
    --   where: YY   - last two digits of year (only years
    --                 between 1900-1999)
    --          YYYY - last four digits of the year (any year)
    --          MM   - month (01 through 12)
    --          DD   - day of month (01 through 31)
    --          HH   - hours (00 through 23)
    --          MM   - minutes (00 through 59)
    --          Z    - denotes GMT (the ASCII character Z)
    --
    -- For example, "9502192015Z" and "199502192015Z" represent
    -- 8:15pm GMT on 19 February 1995. Years after 1999 must use
    -- the four digit year format. Years 1900-1999 may use the
    -- two or four digit format.
